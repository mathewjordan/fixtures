00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.430
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There is a landscape that begins in the
deep canyons and fertile valleys of Oregon

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.980
and rolls like a ribbon through Idaho until
it reaches the high plains of north central Montana.

4
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.730
Embedded in the fabric of this land
and the people who live here is the memory

5
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.730
of one of our nation's most enduring stories.
It is an epic story of hope, despair, and

6
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.039
ultimately loss of a homeland. Even though
it happened long ago, this story remains as

7
00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:51.039
current as today's headlines.
This is the Nez Perce National Historic Trail,

8
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:59.820
and as you travel the landscape, this journey grows
more significant with time. For thousands

9
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.340
of generations the people who call themselves
"Nimiipuu" used this trail across the mountains

10
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.170
to visit friends and relatives on the plains;
to trade and to hunt the buffalo.

11
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.170
They learned to follow the trail in the
days of foot travel, long before horses.

12
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.340
According to legend, Grizzly bears found a brave, lost boy
and showed him the path through the mountains and how to

13
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.340
survive in this rugged country. Then in 1877,
the path became a trail of sadness.

14
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:44.560
In that year 750 Nez Perce men, women and children
made a heroic yet futile flight seeking freedom

15
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.560
and peace far from their homeland. But this
trail is not just about yesterday's journeys.

16
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.240
Today's and tomorrow's travelers may also
find meaning here. The Nez Perce National

17
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.240
Historic Trail is a landscape of history that
carries understanding to those who travel it.

18
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.240
The Nez Perce Tribe's native homeland
extended across a plateau country

19
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:21.470
of ancient volcanic rock, deep canyons and mighty
rivers between the Cascade and Rocky Mountains.

20
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:29.379
Separate Nez Perce bands once lived from Oregon's
Wallowa Valley, up and down the Snake River Canyon,

21
00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:36.379
to the Clearwater Valley in Idaho. Their lands
spread north and south along the Bitterroot

22
00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.769
Range, encompassing the rugged Lochsa and
Selway drainages and the extensive Salmon

23
00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.769
River country. It was, and still is, a beautiful
and abundant land, rich in

24
00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:59.450
wildlife, productive forests and lush meadows. Nez Perce
ancestors thrived here for thousands of generations.

25
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.459
The story of the Nez Perce conflict began
with the arrival of white men in the early

26
00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.299
1800s. The Nez Perce aided explorers Lewis
and Clark, and they traded with early fur trappers.

27
00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.299
Christian missionaries lived among
them. Early settlers knew and respected the

28
00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.299
Nez Perce as skillful horse breeders, hunters
and warriors. For fifty years the Nez Perce

29
00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:34.109
and their new neighbors lived together, side
by side. By 1855, increasing

30
00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:43.029
numbers of settlers looking for land and prosperity
expanded into Nez Perce country. That year Washington

31
00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:50.579
Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens established a Nez
Perce Reservation of nearly 12,000 square miles,

32
00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:58.950
preserving much of the tribe's native homeland.
Just five years later, prospectors encroaching

33
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.249
on Nez Perce land discovered gold, and the
U.S. government demanded new treaty talks.

34
00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:13.579
In 1863 new negotiations led to a tenfold
reduction in land for the Nez Perce.

35
00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:23.000
Several bands whose traditional lands were not included
in the reservation refused to sign the treaty.

36
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They became known as the "Non-treaty" Nez
Perce. Now divided, the Nez Perce Tribe

37
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.970
became increasingly vulnerable to pressure from
homesteaders and the U.S. Government. For over a decade,

38
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.430
the non-treaty bands refused to leave their
lands. But tensions mounted with growing numbers

39
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.389
of settlers, and in 1877 the Army ordered
the non-treaty Nez Perce to move on to the

40
00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.389
reduced reservation near Lapwai, Idaho.
Of the 750 Nez Perce, most were

41
00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:07.819
women, children, or elderly. They took with them
their 2000 horses and all their belongings.

42
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:16.050
In the months before their departure, relations had grown
tense between Nez Perce and neighboring settlers.

43
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.050
Some settlers badly mistreated and even killed
some Nez Perce. On the journey to the reservation,

44
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.620
several young angry warriors sought justice
for these unprosecuted murders and killed

45
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.620
a number of settlers they believed were responsible.
This set the stage for further bloodshed.

46
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.860
Army troops and civilian volunteers led by
General Oliver Otis Howard first confronted

47
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.849
the Nez Perce at White Bird Canyon. Fighting
broke out, and the troops retreated with heavy

48
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:55.849
casualties. This was the first of nearly 20
battles and skirmishes. Even though many

49
00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:03.879
Americans were sympathetic to the Nez Perce, the policy
of Manifest Destiny, the taming of the "wild west"

50
00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:10.210
and expansion of American commerce and
civilization was still of prime importance

51
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.210
in 1877. The rights of the non-treaty Nez
Perce were largely ignored.

52
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:25.430
From the Whitebird Battlefield, the Nez Perce fled
northwest to the Salmon River, then east toward the

53
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.430
Clearwater River. General Howard's troops
attacked again, with little success.

54
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:39.530
After the Clearwater battle, the Nez Perce camped
at Weippe Prairie where leaders met to decide

55
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:46.530
what to do next. The leaders included, among
many others, Joseph, Whitebird, Toohoolhoolzote,

56
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:54.939
Hahtalekin, Husishusis Kute, and Looking Glass.
&gt;&gt; CHIEF JOSEPH: "What are we fighting for?

57
00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:02.699
Is it for our lives? No. It is for this land where
the bones of our fathers lie buried. I do not want to

58
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:09.699
take my women among strangers. I do not want to
die in a strange land." Chief Joseph.

59
00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:20.810
&gt;&gt;NARRATOR: Chief Looking Glass had only recently joined
the fleeing bands when his Clearwater River camp

60
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.360
was destroyed by troops. Because of his knowledge
of buffalo country, the chiefs agreed to follow

61
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.360
Looking Glass from Idaho to Montana in search
of allies. As they pursued the fleeing bands

62
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.310
onto the Weippe Prairie, General Howard's
troops intercepted Chief Redheart's band returning

63
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:47.310
home from a buffalo hunt. Victims of bad timing,
Redheart's band were captured and taken as

64
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:54.379
prisoners of war to Fort Vancouver, Washington.
They remained there until April of 1878.

65
00:07:54.379 --> 00:08:05.249
The fleeing Nez Perce followed the winding Lolo
Trail up the Lochsa River and over the Bitterroot

66
00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:12.249
Mountains. The Lolo Trail was a well-known
hunters' trail, but considered tortuous with

67
00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:20.710
dense forests, steep canyons and a 7000-foot
summit. Across this rugged terrain the Nez

68
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:27.680
Perce deftly outdistanced the pursuing army.
Hoping to stop the Nez Perce at the east end

69
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:34.430
of the Lolo trail, Army and volunteer forces
hastily built a blockade near Lolo Creek in Montana.

70
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:41.240
The Nez Perce easily outflanked the
blockade, and the location became known as

71
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:48.240
Fort Fizzle for the failed attempt.
Traveling about twelve miles per day,

72
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:55.950
the Nez Perce moved south through Montana's Bitterroot
Valley to avoid Missoula and other settlements.

73
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:02.260
They traded for supplies with wary settlers along
the way. The Nez Perce crossed the Continental

74
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:08.810
Divide at what is now called Gibbon's Pass
and dropped into the Big Hole Valley. Believing

75
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:15.190
the army was far away, they stopped to rest
and gather tipi poles along the North Fork

76
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:22.190
of the Big Hole River. Here, at the Big Hole
National Battlefield, the National Park Service

77
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:28.480
tells how the 7th Infantry, under the command
of Colonel John Gibbon, surprised the resting

78
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:35.480
tribe on the morning of August 9th. Gibbon described
the attack. &gt;&gt; GIBBON: "Suddenly a single shot

79
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.300
rang out in the clear morning air, followed
quickly by several others, and the whole line

80
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.089
pushed forward through the brush. A heavy
fire was at once opened along the whole line

81
00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:51.510
of tepees, the startled Indians rushing from
them in every direction, and for a few moments

82
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:57.560
no shots were returned. Few of us will forget
the wail of mingled grief, rage and horror

83
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.300
which rose from the camp when the Indians returned
to it and recognized their slaughtered warriors,

84
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:09.300
women and children." &gt;&gt; RED WOLF: "The women,
all scared when the soldiers charged the camp,

85
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.430
ran into the water, the brush. Any place where
they could hide themselves and children. Many

86
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:22.430
were killed as they ran. They had no guns."
Red Wolf, Nez Perce Warrior.

87
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:30.920
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Nearly 90 Nez Perce, including many women
and children, were killed at the battle of Big Hole.

88
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:37.920
Twenty-nine soldiers and citizen volunteers also lost
their lives. Nez Perce leaders suddenly realized

89
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:45.720
the deadly reality of the conflict.
Now led by Chief Lean Elk who knew these

90
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:54.920
trails well, the Nez Perce rapidly, and often
violently, fled pursuing troops. Wounded men,

91
00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:03.649
women and children were dying along the trail. Some,
too weary to continue, chose to stay behind.

92
00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:11.480
The Nez Perce crossed back into Idaho at Bannock
Pass. At Camas Meadows they delayed the pursuing army

93
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:18.480
by raiding and scattering cavalry mules.
The Nez Perce crossed Targhee Pass and escaped

94
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.820
into Yellowstone National Park pursued closely
by the army. Inside the five-year old National

95
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:32.850
Park they captured several tourists. A few
vengeful young warriors killed three. Leaders

96
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:39.949
Lean Elk and Yellow Wolf intervened and the
remaining tourists were given horses and food

97
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:46.949
and released. General Howard was sure he had
the fleeing Nez Perce trapped in the rugged

98
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:54.920
Yellowstone country. He posted troops at every
exit. The Nez Perce moved east into the Absaroka

99
00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.889
Mountains where a blockade of new troops from
the 7th Cavalry waited to intercept them.

100
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:06.560
But the Nez Perce baffled the army and escaped
by choosing an arduous route through steep terrain.

101
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:13.560
The Nez Perce traveled down the rugged
Clark's Fork River canyon and on to the plains

102
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.759
where they sought assistance from the Crow
Tribe. Under pressure from military and Indian

103
00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:26.759
agents, the Crow refused to help their former
friends and sided with the army instead.

104
00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:33.600
Now intent on reaching the Canadian border, the
Nez Perce turned north and followed the Clark's

105
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.290
Fork River back into Montana. The cavalry
again caught the Nez Perce at Canyon Creek,

106
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:46.790
but failed once more to halt their march.
After a pitched battle the Nez Perce bands

107
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:52.230
slipped away into the Buffalo Country. They
spread out over the prairies to find game

108
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:59.230
and water and continued their march north.
Cow Island crossing was a supply depot and

109
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:06.410
the most upstream point of steamboat navigation
on the Missouri River in the fall. Pausing

110
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:12.570
only briefly, Nez Perce warriers managed to
take food and supplies from outnumbered and

111
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:19.570
outgunned depot attendants. The fall weather
turned bitterly cold. The Nez Perce

112
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:28.269
had been constantly on the march for over four months
covering more than 1100 miles. They were exhausted

113
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:36.490
and starving. Assuming the army was far behind,
Chief Lookinglass resumed leadership

114
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:44.680
and slowed the pace to protect the weary people.
They selected a camp on Snake Creek at the base

115
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:51.680
of the Bear Paw Mountains, more for comfort
than for defense. These miscalculations proved

116
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:59.040
fateful. On September 30, Colonel Nelson Miles
led 400 soldiers in a surprise

117
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:07.529
attack on the Nez Perce camp. A brutal siege lasted
six days, with heavy casualties on both sides.

118
00:14:07.529 --> 00:14:15.319
During the battle, Chief Whitebird and nearly
200 Nez Perce managed to escape to the safety

119
00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:22.319
of the Canadian border. Most other Nez Perce
leaders were killed. On October 5th, to protect

120
00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:30.009
his wounded, freezing and starving people,
Chief Joseph agreed to end the fighting.

121
00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:40.029
The Nez Perce National Historic Trail ends at
the Bear Paw Battle Site, but the tragic story

122
00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:47.029
does not. The 431 Nez Perce survivors who
had been told they would return to Idaho were

123
00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:55.500
taken instead down the Missouri River by flatboat
to an unexpected exile, first at Ft. Leavenworth,

124
00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:03.389
Kansas, then Indian Territory, Oklahoma. There
they were joined by other Nez Perce captured

125
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:10.389
trying to return home from Canada to Idaho.
Conditions in exile were extremely poor.

126
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:19.060
Of nearly 500 Nez Perce sent to Oklahoma,
only 301 survived. Many

127
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:27.529
military officers and citizens throughout the country pleaded
to have the Nez Perce returned to their reservation.

128
00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:34.529
In spite of these efforts, the Nez Perce remained
in exile for eight years. Finally in 1885

129
00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:42.949
the survivors were sent back to the Northwest.
Chief Joseph and half the surviving Nez Perce

130
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:49.519
were re-settled on the Colville Reservation
in Washington State; the rest were returned

131
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:56.339
to the reservation in Idaho. Chief Joseph
was never permitted to live again at his

132
00:15:56.339 --> 00:16:01.339
ancestral home in the Wallowa Valley.

133
00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:21.339
[music]

134
00:16:21.339 --> 00:16:23.339
More than a century has passed.

135
00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:33.829
Nez Perce decendents of both treatyand non-treaty bands
still live on or near traditional homelands and perpetuate

136
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:40.430
the culture of their proud and once unified tribe. Much
of the country once home to the Nez Perce

137
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:46.550
has been parceled out in farms, ranches, and
communities: but a significant portion is

138
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:53.240
managed as public lands, by federal agencies
like the Forest Service, National Park Service,

139
00:16:53.240 --> 00:17:00.240
Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service. The 1170

140
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:09.910
mile Nez Perce, or Nimiipuu, National Historic Trail
was established by Congress in 1986 to insure

141
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:18.540
that the trail and significant sites will be
preserved and appreciated by generations to come.

142
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:25.640
The US Forest Service is responsible for managing
the Nez Perce National Historic Trail. With

143
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:31.820
this responsibility comes a commitment to
preserve this important heritage. Many trail

144
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:38.820
segments that wind through public land are
amazingly undisturbed and have changed little.

The Nez Perce conflict touched many lives
in 1877. It affected most directly those who

147
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:04.960
fought to enforce the government's will and
those who fought for their homeland. It still

148
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.510
affects those who travel the trail today,
more than a century later. To descendents

149
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:22.510
of both treaty and non-treaty bands of Nez
Perce this trail and its history are sacred.

150
00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:29.510
The trail speaks in many voices. The important
battlefields have been preserved and interpreted.

151
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:38.750
The trail continues to define all of us as
people. The trail largely belongs to the future.

152
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:46.270
The Nez Perce flight for freedom, played out
over vast distances and varied terrain, can

153
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:53.270
only be imagined today as one travels the
trail. But the desire for homeland, that abiding

154
00:18:53.270 --> 00:19:00.590
sense of peace and harmony one feels when
surrounded by familiar landscapes, is as real

155
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:08.990
today as it was for the Nez Perce over one
hundred years ago.
